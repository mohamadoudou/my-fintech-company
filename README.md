##why I chose the Language and or framework.

I used simple HTML, Scss. I choose these technologies because the website I designed is simple and there no complicated flow of logic.
If the website was complexed I would use Reactjs. Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). It allows users to use CSS as a programming language and generate a CSS that is compatible with all browsers.

##choice of design elements

I used 'Lato' sans-serif as a font family because it is one of the most unique and interesting sans-serif fonts and includes 10 styles.
all the colors I use are base on the main color(green). The text color was chosen so that it can be read without difficulty.
